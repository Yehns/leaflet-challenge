Module 15

By utilizing an API, we can plot the coordinates of the most recent earthquakes that have occurred within the last 24 hours. This plot includes a variety of information about the type of earthquake, such as its magnitude, location, and depth. Additionally, an index is provided to display a legend that includes a map with both street and topographic layers.
